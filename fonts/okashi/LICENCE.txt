Okashi took katakana shape, and take it to the cute cartoon children world. With rounded shape and cut-out on the intersection, emphasize the cuteness but still action feel on it.

Suit perfectly for Online Games, poster, movie title, fast food menu, magazine, youtube covers, youtube thumbnails, social media page covers and so onâ€¦

Happy designing.
